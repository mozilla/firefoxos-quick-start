#Firefox OS Quick Start#

The [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/) platform gives web developers exactly what they've wanted for years:  a mobile environment dedicated to apps created with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This guide aims to get you up and running with an environment and basic app architecture so that you can create the next great app!

*To follow along with this guide, you can [download the quick start app](https://github.com/mozilla/firefoxos-quick-start/archive/master.zip).*


##App Structure##

###Packaged vs. Hosted Apps###
There are two types of Firefox OS apps:  `packaged` and `hosted`.  Packaged apps are essentially a zip file containing all of of an app's assets:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, manifest, etc.  Hosted apps are run from a server at a given domain, just like a standard website.  Both app types require a valid manifest.  When it comes time to list your app on the Firefox Marketplace, you will either upload your app as a zip file or provide the URL to where your hosted app lives.

For the purposes of this guide, you'll be creating a hosted app which will live at your `localhost` address.  Once your app is ready to list on the Firefox Marketplace, you can make the decision to bundle it as a packaged app or launch it as a hosted app.


###App Manifests###
Every Firefox app requires a [`manifest.webapp`](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/manifests) file at the app root.  The `manifest.webapp` file provides important information about the app, like version, name, description, icon location, locale strings, domains the app can be installed from, and much more (only the name and description are required).  The simple manifest included in the app template looks like this:

	{
		"version": "0.1",
		"name": "Your App",
		"description": "Your new awesome Open Web App",
		"launch_path": "/index.html",
		"icons": {
			"16": "/img/icons/mortar-16.png",
			"48": "/img/icons/mortar-48.png",
			"128": "/img/icons/mortar-128.png"
		},
		"developer": {
			"name": "Your Name",
			"url": "http://yourawesomeapp.com"
		},
		"installs_allowed_from": ["*"],
		"locales": {
			"es": {
				"description": "Su nueva aplicaci√≥n impresionante Open Web",
				"developer": {
					"url": "http://yourawesomeapp.com"
				}
			},
			"it": {
				"description": "Il vostro nuovo fantastico Open Web App",
				"developer": {
					"url": "http://yourawesomeapp.com"
				}
			}
		},
		"default_locale": "en",
		"type": "privileged",
		"permissions": {
			"systemXHR": { "description": "Required for certain web communications" }
		}
	}



More specific details can be added as the project gets closer to completion, as is the case with most Firefox OS apps.  A basic manifest will do to get started. 


##App Layout & Design##
Responsive design has become increasingly important as more screen resolutions become standard on different devices.  Even if your app targets only Firefox OS, it's important to remember that Firefox OS can be installed on a [variety of devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites) which use different screen resolutions.  [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Media_queries) provide a means to adapt layout to device:

	/* The following are examples of different CSS media queries */

	/* Basic desktop/screen width sniff */
	@media only screen and (min-width : 1224px) {
		/* styles */
	}

	/* Traditional iPhone width */
	@media
		only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio : 1.5),
		only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio : 1.5) {
		/* styles */
	}

	/* Device settings at different orientations */
	@media screen and (orientation:portrait) {
		/* styles */
	}
	@media screen and (orientation:landscape) {
		/* styles */
	}


There are many JavaScript and CSS frameworks available to aid in responsive design and mobile app development ([Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/, [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com), etc.);  choose the framework(s) that best fit your app and development style.  

One nice utility is Mozilla's [mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar).  Mortar doesn't provide responsive design help, but it does provide app templates with a few JavaScript utilities to aid in Firefox OS mobile development, like [zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) (a light alternative to jQuery) and a utility to install your app on the Firefox OS Simulator.  This quick start guide uses mortar's most basic layout template:
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html manifest="offline.appcache">
	  <head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">

	    <title>My App</title>
	    <meta name="description" content="">
	    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

	    <!-- Place favicon.ico in the root directory -->

	    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css">
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    <!-- Use this installation button to install locally without going
	         through the marketpace (see app.js) -->
	    <button id="install-btn">Install</button>    

	    <!-- Write your application here -->

	    
	    
	    <!-- Using require.js, a module system for JavaScript, include the
	         js files. This loads "init.js", which in turn can load other
	         files, all handled by require.js:
	         http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#jsfiles -->
	    <script type="text/javascript" data-main="js/init.js" src="js/lib/require.js"></script>
	  </body>
	</html>


Feel free to modify the structure set out by mortar -- the snippet above should get you going.  Note that all JavaScript code must be in separate `.js` files;  no inline scripting is allowed.


##Web APIs##
JavaScript APIs are being created and enhanced as quickly as devices are.  Mozilla's [WebAPI](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI) effort brings dozens of standard mobile features to JavaScript APIs.  A list of device support and status is available on the [App permissions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/App_permissions) page.  Of course JavaScript feature detection is still the best practice for checking if a WebAPI is available:

	// If this device supports the vibrate API...
	if('vibrate' in navigator) {
		// ... vibrate for a second
		navigator.vibrate(1000);
	}

In this very basic app template we'll modify the display style of a `DIV` based on changes in the device's battery state:

	// Create the battery indicator listeners
	(function() {
	  var battery = navigator.battery || navigator.mozBattery || navigator.webkitBattery,
	      indicator, indicatorPercentage;

	  if(battery) {
	    indicator = document.getElementById('indicator'),
	    indicatorPercentage = document.getElementById('indicator-percentage');

	    // Set listeners for changes
	    battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', updateBattery);
	    battery.addEventListener('levelchange', updateBattery);

	    // Update immediately
	    updateBattery();
	  }

	  function updateBattery() {
	    // Update percentage width and text
	    var level = (battery.level * 100) + '%';
	    indicatorPercentage.style.width = level;
	    indicatorPercentage.innerHTML = 'Battery: ' + level;
	    // Update charging status
	    indicator.className = battery.charging ? 'charging' : '';
	  }
	})();

In the code sample above, once you confirm that the [Battery API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.navigator.battery) is supported, you can add event listeners for `chargingchange` and `levelchange` to update the element's display.

Check the [WebAPI](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI) page frequently to keep up to date with device API statuses!


##WebRT APIs (Permissions-based APIs)##
There are a number of [WebAPIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/App_permissions) available, but they require permissions for that specific feature to be enabled.  Apps must register permission requests in the `manifest.webapp` file:
	
	"permissions": {
		"systemXHR": { "description": "Required for AJAX calls in app"}
	}

Because the `systemXHR` permission requires that the app be a privileged app, you must also add this to `manifest.webapp`:

	"type": "privileged"

Once you've installed your app on Firefox OS Simulator, open the `Settings` app, select `App Permissions`, select your app, and enable permissions as desired.  It's important to note that not all WebAPIs have been implemented yet in the Firefox OS Simulator.


##Tools & Testing##
Testing is incredibly important when supporting mobile devices.  There are many options for testing FirefoxOS apps:

###Firefox OS Simulator###
Installing and using the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/firefox_os_simulator) is the easiest way to get up and running with your app.  After you install the simulator, you can start it from the `Tools` -> `Web Developer` -> `Firefox OS Simulator` menu.  The simulator launches with a JavaScript console so you can debug your app from within the simulator!

###Unit Testing###
Unit tests are extremely valuable when testing on different devices and builds.  jQuery's  [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) is a popular client-side testing utility, but you can use any set of testing tools you like.  

###Installing Firefox OS on a Device###
Since Firefox OS is an open source platform, code and tools are available to build and install Firefox OS on your own device.  Build and installation instructions can be found on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform).  Firefox OS preview devices will be available through [Geeksphone](http://www.geeksphone.com/) soon.



##App Submission and Distribution##
Once your app is complete, you can [submit it](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/submit/app/manifest) to the [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/).  Your app's manifest will be validated and you can choose which devices your app will support (i.e. Firefox OS, Desktop Firefox, Firefox Mobile, Firefox Tablet).  Once validated you can add additional details about your app (screenshots, descriptions, price, etc.) and officially submit the app for listing in the Marketplace.  Once approved, your app is available to the world for purchase and installation!
